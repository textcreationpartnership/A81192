                  <note>"The author of the Trip to Holland" in the above title prepared a 1697 edition of Owen Felltham's "Batavia: or the Hollanders display'd" (originally published in 1672; Wing F647C), to which, according to the contents of the work being catalogued here, he added "two sheets and an half" and called it "A trip to Holland, because a certain scurrilous nonsensical pamphlet had sold well under the name of a trip", i.e. "A trip to Jamaica" by Edward Ward (1698; Wing W763). It is possible that the copies reported at Wing F659 and F659A, i.e. "A trip to Holland", include both this work, laudatory to the Netherlands, and the "scurrilous nonsensical pamphlet" of the same title.</note>
                  <note>A reply to "A trip to Holland", the scurrilous satire referred to above. Our anonymous author clearly believes it to be by Edward Ward, since in his text he alludes to "the fiery plantation author", referring to Ward's "A trip to Jamaica" and names Ward's printer, "J. How", the printer of that work</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE fiery <hi>Plantation Author</hi> perhaps may be angry, that I liken him to ſo little an Animal as a Monkey in the Title, when in his <hi>Tower-hill</hi> Simile he aſſumes to himſelf the mighty Image of a true bred Maſtiff; tho' where his <hi>Breeding</hi> is I can't tell; for I underſtand at the Derby Ale-houſe that his Friends never bred him a Scholar, but where his want of it appears may be eaſily diſcernable, even by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who has none.</p>
            <p>The way to give him no further provocation is to Anſwer him in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and then your ſure not to be underſtood, unleſs he happily lights on <hi>Tom. Brown</hi> to expound it to him, and the way to provoke him is much more difficult to be found, if our Champion pleaſes to remember who 'twas challeng'd him before his Printer, and could get nothing more from him then that he liv'd at <hi>Iſlington;</hi> And this is an inſtance of his <hi>Courage, Contempt,</hi> and <hi>holding up his Leg,</hi> and <hi>ſcornfully piſſing upon his trembling Aſſailant;</hi> ſo it is an Evident Sign our Dealer in <hi>Similitudes,</hi> after he was not ſuffer'd to be one in <hi>Sugar,</hi> is as far from having any juſt claim to the uſe of a Cudgel for his Talent, as he has to the uſe of a Pen.</p>
            <p>But our Author is eager for doing the World Juſtice, and the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly ſauce-box</hi> muſt be diſcover'd, who dar'd yelp at the Heels of this <hi>Diſdainful Bull-dog.</hi> I warrant you he thinks he deſerves as much at leaſt as Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> for the <hi>Diſcovery of his Horrid Plot</hi> againſt the Purſes of his Majeſty's Subjects. A Bookſeller in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> ſhew'd him <hi>Feltham</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, pointed out the place to him, and with much ado, he Read it.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Monſtrum Horrendum!</hi> Here is a Plagiariſm in Perfection, a whole Sheet and an half ſtolen, and not fall under the Cenſure of ſome Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate for it. But theſe two Words of Latin has ſent him in the ſearch of ſome Interpreter to give him the Engliſh of them. And now in his abſence, I muſt do my ſelf and the Bookſeller the ſame Juſtice he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do to the World.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman brought a ſmall Pamphlet in 12's to my Bookſeller, Entitul'd <hi>Batavia, or the Hollanders diſplay'd,</hi> but no Author, or Bookſeller's Name to it, but only Printed in the Year 1697. This he told him he brought from <hi>Holland,</hi> and advis'd him to Print it, as being full of pretty delightful Remarks. Accordingly it was brought me, and after adding two Sheets and an half to it, we agreed to call it a <hi>Trip to Holland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a certain ſcurrilous nonſenſical Pamphlet had ſold well under the Name of a Trip. This, upon the Word of a Gentleman, a Title, to which our <hi>Curry-Comber</hi> has no Plea, is the real Truth, and we were led on in this ignorance, till the Day or two before it was publiſhed, when it was too late, to recall a Deſign, the Bookſeller had been at too great a charge, and trouble in carrying on, to loſe the Publication of.</p>
            <p>He is ſorry for the Man who deals in Books, and I am ſorry for him who pretends to write them; but I am ſure the laſt does not deſerve the Pity which the firſt is above. <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> ſhould be the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of a good <hi>Poet;</hi> but how he comes to make this applicable to a Man who improves in his Trade, is Reputable amongſt his Neighbours, and is eſteem'd as a Companion for better Gentlemen than the <hi>Jamaica</hi>-Author, or his ignorant Printer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I cannot tell, unleſs the buſie <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> Book-ſeller told him.</p>
            <p>As he has deſcrib'd me to be a Little, Shallow-brain'd Fellow, ſo it will not be out of the way to give a Deſcription of him. To begin
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153165:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore with his Face; It is Ruſſet-colour'd, with Pock-holes in it; and as that is ſomewhat broader than ordinary, ſo his Skull, whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs is the only Argument of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature, is proportionable. His Body is a long Ox's Bladder, blown up with the Wind of <hi>Derby</hi>-Ale: His Legs too have partaken of the ſame <hi>Flatus;</hi> and he looks like a Man who Cudgels People as much as he talks of it. For his Apparel, it all came out of one Shop: No one has the Impudence to call his Wigg a Second-handed one, for it was the Caſt-off of ſome <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and he had it from his Maſter, the Broker from him, and he from the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. The Sword was ſome disbanded Trooper's, a ſwinging one, which was pawn'd for a Shilling, and ſo our Author had a Bargain in it in buying it for Two. His Cravat and Ruffles, for I muſt tell you, when he came to Bully me, he had Hand-Cuffs, look'd as if they had the Yellow-Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and yawn'd at as many Holes as his own <hi>Jamaica</hi> did when it had an Earth-quake, which he calls <hi>the Dry Belly-Ach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Fancy</hi> is not <hi>Muſhroon,</hi> as he calls mine, which grows up to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in one Night; but he muſt have two Days and a Night to ſpoil what another would have perfected in half an Hour, elſe he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſpent <hi>Saturday, Sunday,</hi> and the Night following, on ſo trifling an Half-ſheet as his <hi>Trip to</hi> Holland <hi>Detected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his being a Tranſported Felon, I ſhall not concern my ſelf who incerted it, tho' he is ſo poſitive in his Man: Ev'n let it be as he thinks, for I ſhould loſe more than his Satisfaction would make me Amends for, ſhould I take the pains to inform him.</p>
            <p>And for his pretending to inſinuate to the World, that I call'd my Bookſeller <hi>the Ignorant PUPPY, my Chap,</hi> I ſhould do well to lay the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance at his own Door, whoſe Brain is ſo ſhallow as not to fathom the Meaning of it. For once therefore, to hold a Light to his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is <hi>hid under the Buſhel, his Skull,</hi> for I told you before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of it, I declare, I have more Reſpect for my Book-ſeller, than to load him with any ſuch Character; and I deſire him, who was one of the Readers, to take it to himſelf.</p>
            <p>His laſt Paragraph but one, has Occaſion for a more ſerious Anſwer. Here he would faſten a Crime upon me, which I declare, in the Preſence of God, I know nothing of, directly, or indirectly; and know no more of what he means by his ambiguous ſpeaking of a Silver Tankard, than he did my Senſe when I ſaid <hi>the Puppy, my Chap.</hi> Indeed, I have ſold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books, and cannot but think he had done me more Juſtice, had he ſaid, my Family (which he owns to be that of a Gentleman) had been diſgrac'd by their with-holding Money from me, not by my ſelling of Books. And, for writing <hi>Obſcene Ballads, Bloody Murthers,</hi> and <hi>Laſt Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Speeches,</hi> he cannot but remember where the Reflection lies, ſince he was <hi>W</hi>— the Printer's Journey-man for a conſiderable time.</p>
            <p>The laſt Paragraph gives you the Declaration of our Exaſperated Bull-Dog: He tells the World, as if he were at his laſt Confeſſion, he never wrote the <hi>Anſwer to the Trip to</hi> Holland. And what of all this? He has <hi>Curry'd</hi> himſelf <hi>out of the World's Favaur</hi> without it, by his Preſent of the <hi>Curry-Comb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, for the Paper will hold no more, neither the Author, or the Book-ſeller, value the Threatnings of his <hi>Cane,</hi> or his <hi>London-Spy;</hi> but both are of the ſame Opinion with a great Writer at <hi>Will</hi>'s Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe, That <hi>now the Fool has written himſelf into ſome Reputation amongſt the Mob, he is writing Poſt to get out of it again.</hi>
